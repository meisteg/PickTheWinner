    <!-- Rule Book Strings -->
    <string name="scoring_header">Weekly Scoring</string>
    <string name="scoring">Every week that there is a point paying Sprint Cup Series event,
        five questions related to the event will be asked on Thursday. Each question has its
        own individual point value, for a total of 200 points:\n\n
        &#8226; <b>100 points</b>: Pick The Winner of the race\n
        &#8226; <b>50 points</b>: Answer Question 2 correctly\n
        &#8226; <b>35 points</b>: Answer Question 3 correctly\n
        &#8226; <b>10 points</b>: Pick the leader of most laps\n
        &#8226; <b>5 points</b>: Pick number of lap leaders
        \n\nYou can make your picks until one hour prior to the scheduled green flag. Once the
        race is completed the points will be calculated within 24 hours of the race results
        being made official by NASCAR.</string>
    <string name="chase_header">The Chase</string>
    <string name="chase">After the 26th race of the season the players in the top 10 in points
        are automatically qualified for The Chase. In addition, there are two "wild card"
        qualifiers, specifically the two players with the most race wins who are ranked between
        11th and 20th in points.\n\nPlayers who qualify for The Chase will have their point totals
        reset to 5,000 points. The 10 automatic qualifiers receive a bonus of 10 points for
        each race win during the regular season, while the two wild cards receive no such bonus.
        The scoring for the remaining 10 races is the same as the first 26 races.</string>
    <string name="tie_header">Tie Breakers</string>
    <string name="tie">When players are tied with the same number of points, the following tie
        breakers will be used, in order, to determine the standings:\n\n
        &#8226; Player with more wins\n
        &#8226; Player who participated in more races\n
        &#8226; Player who answered questions first
        \n\nWhen selecting the two wild cards for The Chase, if there are multiple players tied
        with the same number of wins, the player(s) higher in the standings will be qualified
        for The Chase.</string>
