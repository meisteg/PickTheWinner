            <h1>Pick The Winner Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p>
                This privacy policy governs your use of the software application Pick The Winner
                (“Application”) for mobile devices that was created by Gregory Meiste (“I”, “me” or

            </p>

            <h2>Collection and Use of Information</h2>
            <p>
                When you install the Application, your device ID will be stored on the Google App
                Engine server for this game. Upon selecting which Google account to use in the
                Application, the selected email address will also be stored on the server. Any
                information you submit via the Application, including, but not limited to, your
                answers to the race questions, question suggestions, player name and friend links
                will be stored on the server.
            </p>
            <p>The collected information will be used to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>allow you to switch devices and restore all your game data to your new device;</li>
                <li>notify your device to re-sync with the server when something has changed;</li>
                <li>determine the selected questions for a race;</li>
                <li>calculate your score based on outcome of races;</li>
                <li>ensure your friend(s) are always displayed in the Standings on your device.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Should you provide a player name, it will be visible to other players.</p>

            <h2>Sharing and Disclosure of Information</h2>
            <p>I may disclose user provided and automatically collected information:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process;</li>
                <li>when I believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect my rights,
                    protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a
                    government request;
                </li>
                <li>to advertisers and third party advertising networks and analytics companies as
                    described below.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Advertising</h2>
            <p>
                The Application may display advertisements using AdMob by Google. Detailed
                information about what data Google collects and how Google handles the collected
                data can be found in their <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/">privacy

            </p>

            <h2>In-app Purchases</h2>
            <p>
                The Application may invite you to purchase items, including but not limited to the
                option to remove advertising. I will never have access to sensitive billing
                information such as credit card or bank account details. The

            </p>

            <h2>Analytics Collection</h2>
            <p>
                The Application uses <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/mobile/">Google

                your mobile devices unique device ID, your mobile operating system version, and

            <h2>Managing Your Information</h2>
            <p>
                Due to technological reasons, it may not always be possible to know when and if you
                delete the Application. Therefore, if no activity is detected from your device for
                180 days, it will be assumed that you deleted the application and your device ID
                will be removed from the server. However, your account (which is your email address)
                will not be removed to allow you to resume play in the event of non-use.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you wish to delete your account completely, please send an email to
                <a href="mailto:greg.meiste@gmail.com">greg.meiste@gmail.com</a>.
            </p>

            <h2>Children</h2>
            <p>
                The Application is not intended for or designed to attract anyone under the age of
                13 and I do not intentionally or knowingly collect Personal Information from anyone
                under the age of 13 (or older in some jurisdictions). If a parent or guardian
                becomes aware that his or her child has provided me with information without their
                consent, he or she should contact me at <a href="mailto:greg.meiste@gmail.com">
                greg.meiste@gmail.com</a>. I will delete such information within a reasonable time.
            </p>

            <h2>Security</h2>
            <p>
                Reasonable precautions are made to protect Personal Information from misuse, loss
                and unauthorized access. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or
                method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.
            </p>

            <h2>Changes</h2>
            <p>
                This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason and without
                notice. If changes are made to this Privacy Policy, previous versions will be made
                available so that you can see what changes occurred and when. You are advised to
                consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes, as continued use is deemed
                approval of all changes.
            </p>

            <h2>Your Consent</h2>
            <p>
                By using the Application, you are consenting to my processing of your information as
                set forth in this Privacy Policy now and as amended by me. "Processing,” means using
                cookies on a computer/handheld device or using or touching information in any way,
                including, but not limited to, collecting, storing, deleting, using, combining and
                disclosing information, all of which activities will take place in the United States.
                If you reside outside the United States your information will be transferred,
                processed and stored there under United States privacy standards.
