The 16 players who qualify for the Chase Grid will have their point totals reset to 5,000 points, plus receive a bonus of 10 points for each race win during the regular season.",

After the third Chase race, the Chase Grid will be reduced to the top 12 players. After the sixth Chase race, the field will reduce to the top 8 players, and following the ninth Chase race, only the top 4 players will remain eligible for the championship.",
        "When a player advances to the next round, they will receive a 1,000 point bonus. Additionally, as players are eliminated from the rounds, their points total will reset to the Chase-start base of 5,000, plus the additional points they have earned during the Chase."
