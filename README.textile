Pick The Winner is an "Android":http://android.com game that allows "NASCAR":http://nascar.com fans from around the world compete weekly for points which are earned by correctly answering questions about that week's race.

h2. Getting Started

This is the source code to the game. If you are interested in playing the game, you'll need to download it from the Android Market (it's free).

Pick The Winner is built using three "Eclipse":http://eclipse.org projects, which are all included in this repo. You should be able to point the Eclipse project import tool to this directory, and Eclipse will prompt you to import all three projects. Once imported, simply build the PickTheWinner project, which will automatically build and include the other two library projects.
